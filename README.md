# dotfiles

A few of my dotfiles for configs on MacOS/Linux.

Based on the technique described by https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles

Install with 
```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaqsr/dotfiles/master/setup.sh >> setup.sh && chmod +x setup.sh

./setup.sh
```
in your home directory.

# TODO

- [ ] Update and clean up `.zshrc`.
- [ ] Rewrite neovim config. See `.config/nvim-new-WIP/goals.md`
