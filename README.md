# dotfiles

A few of my dotfiles for configs on MacOS/Linux.

Shamelessly using this node script https://github.com/mmellado/dotfiles-sync

TODO: Make it not rely on the node script

Install with 
```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaqsr/dotfiles/master/setup.sh >> setup.sh && chmod +x setup.sh

./setup.sh
```
in your home directory.
